- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @skrollu, I'm a 23 years old french fullstack developer with a master's degree (Master 2 IWOCS) in computer science obtained at Le Havre university. Today I work for SPB Group as JavaEE Backend developer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new technologies of web development.
- On my profile you can see my personal projects and progressions about JS frameworks, style tricks projects and also some of the biggest project done in class (Processing, Arduino...)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front Javascript frameworks (React, Angular and Vue) and their state manager (Redux, Vuex and NGRX). I also try to dockerize my projects.
I learned a bit of new style technologies like Three.js and WebGL and appriciate it.
In my "CSS" project, you can find lots of mini-projects where I try new things with advanced CSS property, create UX-UI components, learn animation libraries like GSAP.
My portfolio is currently work in progress. It's the occasion for me to learn about Webpack, Babel, Swup.js, Barba.js and more about GSAP...
