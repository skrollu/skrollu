- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @skrollu, I'm a french student in 2nd year of MSc (Master 2 IWOCS) in computer science at Le Havre university. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new technologies of web development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript frameworks (React, Angular and Vue) and their state manager (Redux, Vuex and NGRX). I also try to dockerize my projects.
I will soon learn new style technologies like three.js and WebGL that I heard a lot from.
On my profile you can see my personal projects and progressions about JS frameworks and style tricks project and also some of the biggest project made in class (Processing, Arduino...)
